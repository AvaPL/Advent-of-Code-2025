# Puzzle 2

Well, I'm disappointed that it's not Scala ([again](https://github.com/AvaPL/Advent-of-Code-2023/blob/main/src/main/scala/day24/Puzzle2.ipynb)).

However, it's better to use tools appropriate to the problem and avoid reinventing the wheel, isn't it?

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

```shell
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python puzzle2.py
```
